# Chatbot with java swing GUI
This project is a simple chatbot built using Java and the Swing framework for a graphical user interface (GUI). The chatbot can execute basic commands such as responding to greetings, telling the time and date, solving math problems, clearing the screen, and even singing a song. It also handles unrecognized inputs with random error messages to simulate a more conversational interaction.
